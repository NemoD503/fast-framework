If you want to create fast prototype of project, this framework is suitable for you. Fast start. Ease and famous tools and concepts help you create simple project. I don't think that this decision suite to production, use it only for prototyping.

###Start on localhost:

```
npm install
gulp build
npm run start
```

```
npm install
gulp build
npm run server
```
